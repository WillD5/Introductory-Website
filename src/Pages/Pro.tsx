        I'm a Canadian computer science student, I come from that one French
        part of Canada, a blissful place known as Quebec. I enjoy doing
        programming work, especially if it's database-related! My personality
        type is INFJ-T which stands for, in this order, Introverted, Intuitive,
        Feeling, Judging, Turbulent. While I may not have the most extroverted
        personality, I do care deeply about others and am always looking to
        improve by whatever means possible
